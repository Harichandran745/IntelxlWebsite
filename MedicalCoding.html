                        Medical coding audit helps healthcare providers enhance and
                        implement correct clinical documentation processes. Effective

                        Medicare and other insurance schemes. In today’s competitive healthcare
                        landscape healthcare organizations must have regular auditing practices in
                        place to promote organizational transparency and employee performance. However,

                        We audit CPT codes to determine if it has been improperly used. Issues arise at the time of
                        unbundling, upcoding,

                        their place of service code.
                        We audit codes to ensure there are no mistakes in the place of service. This ensures you do not

                        misplaced modifiers. Our modifier
                        audits are carried out to tell payers that there were special circumstances regarding the
                        provision of care. Our assessment

                        The right codes help support the medical necessity of the procedure. We audit files to ensure
                        the assigned codes correspond with the
                        medical necessity. Likewise, we audit to ensure the diagnosis code for a patient is not changed

                        entities, clinical coding and analysis
                        have become quite challenging. Inaccurate or incomplete submission of codes can result in a
                        large number of claims being denied and underpayments,
                        and cause disruptions and bottlenecks in coding workflows. This can leave you with unnecessary
